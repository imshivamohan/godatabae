Key Points:

I've added a PingDatabase function in the database package that:

Creates a database connection
Attempts to ping the database
Logs detailed connection information
Returns any connection errors


Added a TestDatabaseConnection function that can be used in testing scenarios
Updated main.go to include a -ping flag for testing database connections

Usage Examples:
bashCopy# Test database connection
go run main.go -f config.yaml -ping

# Run normal database operations
go run main.go -f config.yaml
Notes:

Replace your_module_name with your actual Go module name
Update config.yaml with your actual database credentials
Modify the example query in main.go to match your database schema

Make sure to:

Initialize your Go module: go mod init your_module_name
Install required dependencies:
Copygo get github.com/rs/zerolog
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v3
go get github.com/lib/pq  # for PostgreSQL


Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation or make any modifications? CopyRetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. HaikuChoose style2 messages remaining until 2:30 PMSubscribe to Pro
