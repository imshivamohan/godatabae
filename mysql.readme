I'll create a comprehensive database library for Go with the features you've described. I'll break this down into multiple files to create a modular and flexible database connection library.

First, let's create the config artifact:

Now, let's create the database connection module:

Let's create a sample main.go to demonstrate usage:

To use this database module, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
bashCopygo get github.com/rs/zerolog
go get gopkg.in/yaml.v3
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
go get github.com/lib/pq
go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
Key Features:

Supports multiple database drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
Configuration via YAML file
Connection pooling configuration
Flexible logging with zerolog
Easy-to-use query methods
Automatic connection management

How to Use:

Create a config.yaml file with your database configuration
Import the database module
Call NewDatabaseConnection() with the path to your config
Use the returned DatabaseConnection to execute queries

Configuration Options:

Choose database driver
Configure connection pool settings
Set logging level and output path
Specify database connection details

Logging Levels:

info: Default logging
debug: Detailed logging for development
error: Only log errors

This implementation provides a flexible, robust database connection module that can be easily integrated into any Go project.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or explain any specific aspect of the database module?
